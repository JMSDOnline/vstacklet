### vstacklet::backup::database()

Backup a database. [see function](https://github.com/JMSDOnline/vstacklet/blob/development/bin/backup/vs-backup#L485-L524)

note: This function will additionally package the database backup into a tarball
and compress it on the fly, then encrypt it. The tarball will be moved to the
destination directory and the temporary directory will be cleaned up.
- To decrypt the tarball, use the following command example: (replace the variables)
```
openssl enc -d -pbkdf2 -in "${db_dir_dest:-/backup/databases/}${db}.sql.${date_stamp}.${compression_extension}.enc" -out "${db_tmp_dir_dest:-/tmp/vstacklet/backup/databases/}${db}.sql.${date_stamp}.${compression_extension}" -k "${db_pass}"
```
- To extract the tarball, use the following command example: (replace the variables)
```
tar -xzf "${db_tmp_dir_dest:-/tmp/vstacklet/backup/databases/}${db}.sql.${date_stamp}.${compression_extension}" -C "${db_tmp_dir_dest:-/tmp/vstacklet/backup/databases/}"
```

### vstacklet::backup::retention()

The retention used in the backup script. This is used to delete
old backups. [see function](https://github.com/JMSDOnline/vstacklet/blob/development/bin/backup/vs-backup#L544-L568)

notes:
- The retention is based on the modification time of the file.
- Default retention is 7 days. This can be changed by setting the `-r` variable.
  - example: `-r 14` would set the retention to 14 days.
- The retention path options are used to exclude directories from the retention.
- Default retention paths are /backup/files/ and /backup/databases/. These can
be changed by setting the `-fdbu` and `-dbdbu` variables.
  - example: `-fdbu /backup/files/backup/` would create and set the file retention
path to /backup/files/backup/.
